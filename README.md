### What's missing in AI?

* **Physical**: Things that we can touch are easier to understand and to connect with
* [Tools](http://cognimates.me) to make it **accessible**: The best way to understand and demystify a new technology is to explore it and build it.
* **Personality**: Interacting with standardised systems may produce alienation, an organically perceived personality might help prevent this. 
* **Emotional**:
  * the most powerful kind of intelligence that we know of, human intelligence, is hard to conceive without emotions. 
  * emotions are a great way to relate to new things and that it’s easier to understand things we relate to.
  * the interaction with an emotional AI is likely to be less alienating.
  * it's more likely to be positively integrated in the family household
  

### Future developments of the project

* Personality: implementing an [internal state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) so the AI develops an individual personality based on its [interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) with the user. Possible implantation: 
  * a Markov chain model based on the [five factors personality model](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/132735/)
  * a Markov chain model based on the [Jungian personality model](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1680/paper7.pdf)
  * non-markovian implementations & other personality models

* Interaction between different embodied AIs:
  * Emergent behaviours
  * How does my AI interact with yours? Does it feel jealous that yours have more legs or more sensors?



### Possible use cases in a household environment and envisioned effects

* Helping cementing certain manners like saying *please* or being thankful.
* Potential applications for kids with autism spectrum disorder: the loaded in 
* The way kids behave towards their friends is an indicator of their emotional state. The AI could be used as tool to unearth and prevent adverse situations a child might be quietly going through, ie. bullying at school.
* *Parental outsourcing, want a child but don't want to spend too much time with s/he? An AI can provide the attention you can't.*
